# Logging

The importer uses [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for structured logging. The format is auto-derived from your Telegram message format, but you can override it explicitly.

```json
"logConfig": {
  "format": "words",
  "logDir": "./logs"
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `format` | _auto_ | Log format. Auto-derived from `telegram.messageFormat` when not set. |
| `logDir` | `./logs` | Directory for rotating log files. In Docker, use an absolute path like `/app/logs` and mount as a volume. |

## Log formats

=== "words (default)"

    Emoji-rich, colorized (pino-pretty). Best for **development and human reading**.

    ```text
    14:23:01 INFO  🏦 Importing discount …
    14:23:14 INFO  ✅ discount: 18 txns 12.3s
    ```

=== "json"

    Structured NDJSON — one JSON object per line. Best for **Docker log aggregators (Loki, ELK, CloudWatch)**.

    ```text
    {"level":"info","time":1716799381000,"bank":"discount","status":"ok","count":18}
    ```

=== "table"

    `[HH:MM:SS] LEVEL message`. Best for **timestamped production logs**.

    ```text
    [14:23:01] INFO  Importing discount
    [14:23:14] INFO  discount: 18 txns 12.3s
    ```

=== "phone"

    `> compact message` (no emojis). Best for **mobile viewing**.

    ```text
    > Importing discount
    > discount: 18 txns 12.3s
    ```

## Auto-derived format

If `format` is not set, it's derived from your Telegram setup:

| `telegram.messageFormat` | Auto-selected `format` |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `summary` (default) | `words` |
| `compact` | `table` |
| `ledger` | `json` |
| `emoji` | `words` |
| `listenForCommands: true` (any format) | `phone` |

## Log file rotation

Log files are written to `logDir` as NDJSON (raw pino format), rotated at **10 MB per file**, and automatically cleaned up after **3 days**.

The `/logs` Telegram command reads from these files — so `logDir` is required if you want bot-driven log inspection.

```bash
# Persist logs across container restarts
-v /host/logs:/app/logs
```

## Deprecated: `maxBufferSize`

`maxBufferSize` is ignored. The `/logs` command now reads from log files (no in-memory buffer).
